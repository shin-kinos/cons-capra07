# cons-capra07 
A Rust program that calculates conservation score a site in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Jensen-Shannon divergence. 

## Description 
* This program scores residue conservation in each site of a MSA. 
* The scoring measure is based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) applied by Capra and Singh [1]. 
* It takes account of background distribution, sequence weighting and gap penalty. 

## Dependencies 

* `colored` ( https://github.com/mackwic/colored ) 

``` 
[dependencies]
colored = "2.0"
``` 

## Installation 

You can compile this program by using `Cargo`. üì¶ü¶Ä

[e. g.] 

``` 
% cd cons-capra07-main
% cargo build --release
``` 
Then the object file is generated in `./target/release` directory. 

## Scoring method 

### Conservation score 
The conservation score is calculated based on JSD as follows:

where ***Pc*** is a site distribution, ***q*** is a background distribution, ***r = (Pc + q) / 2*** and ***RE*** is the Relative Entropy (RE). 

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE that gaps are ignored in calculating site distributions.

### Sequence weighting 
This program supports two types of sequence weighting: 

1. The Position-Based method by Henikoff and Henikoff [2].
2. The Distance-Based method by Vingron and Argos [3]. 

### Gap penalty 
The gap penalties are given as follows:

<img width="1440" alt="equation_seq_weighting" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83740080/140261784-a8acc7c0-95d6-48f1-9787-23b5d1d5aa9b.png">

where ***L*** is the length of a site (or number of the sequences in the MSA) and ***Wj*** is the weighting factor of sequence ***j***. The gap penalty of site ***i*** is given by calculating sum of weighting factors assigned to the gaps in sequence ***j***. 

### Background distribution 

The RE requires a background distribution. In this program, there are nine background distributions you can choose: 

1. BLOSUM62 [4] 
2. AA composition of Swiss-Prot (from UniProt Knowledge Base) 
3. AA composition in extracellular proteins [5]
4. AA composition in membrane proteins [5]
5. AA composition in intracellular proteins [5] 
6. JTT [6] 
7. WAG [7] 
8. LG [8] 
9. Non-biassed distribution (equal rate at 0.05)  

Gaps are ignored as well as site distributions.  

## Input file format
Aligned Multi-FASTA format of amino acid sequences. 

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE that nucleotide sequences are not supported. 

See some example input files in `demo` directory. 

## Usage
Major arguments:

`-i` : Input filename in aligned Multi-FASTA format, REQUIRED.

`-o` : Output filename, REQUIRED.

`-w` : Method of sequence weighting ( "hen" or "va", default "hen" ).

`-b` : Background distribution (default "blosum62").

[e. g.]

```
% ./cons-capra07 -i input.fasta -o output.txt -w va -c yes -t no
```
Type `-h` to see other available options.

## Output

Number`\t`Conservation score`\t`Composition of the site
